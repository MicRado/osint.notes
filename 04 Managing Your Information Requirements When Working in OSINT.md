Information Requirements

An information requirement is simply a question that addresses an information gap that you have identified in relation to the topic or situation that you are conducting research on. In this video, we'll discuss how to manage your information requirements and define your 'starting point' for an open source investigation.

Pivoting: a key method for searching

Pivoting in OSINT refers to the process of gathering a piece of information, finding indicators of other sources, and then moving on to those sources to ascertain further information.

  - We are continually searching different parts of the web to answer our information requirements
  - As we start to identify information of value, we analyse and make judgements about its usefulness and quality, and look for new leads
  - We then PIVOT to correlated information and continue our search
  - Each time we find new information (related to our issue), we (may) answer our information requirements and start to piece together our ‘intelligence picture’

Example:

  - After finding a person's Instagram username on Facebook, you can pivot to their Instagram account to identify further information and accounts.
  - Their Instagram account contains a link to their personal website - this becomes your next 'pivot point'.

It is important to document how, why and when you pivot - if you have identified a new username or account, document how you found it, and how you know that it's the right one.

Your collection of open source information is rarely a "one and done" situation - as your analysis matures, and new information requirements arise, you will likely need to undertake additional research and collection. Identifying pivot points will make this a lot more straightforward!
