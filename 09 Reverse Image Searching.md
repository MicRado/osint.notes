Reverse image searching involves providing the search engine with an image.

These tools have multiple uses, such as:
- Confirming an image is current.
- Discovering if the image is associated with a particular story, location or event.
- Finding an article or website associated to an image or logo.
- Assist in finding the originator or time of creation.

 Use multiple search engines, as each of them have their strengths, and can return differing information.

There is a need to understand which Browser Extensions we can use, and how we can enable Google Lens in our browser. We'll also look at using these tools to extract written text from images, including text in a foreign language.

A quick tip when searching online and utilising images, right click the image and select "Open Image in New Tab". This will sometimes bring back a larger image and allow you to easily download the file.
