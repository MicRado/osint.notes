### How Google Works

Before we look at how to search more efficiently in Google, it's important to understand how Google (and other search engines, like DuckDuckGo, Yandex, and Bing) return search results. There are three key steps - crawling, indexing, and serving.

- Crawling
   - Downloads items from pages with automated programs called crawlers
- Indexing 
   - Analyses and stores items in a reasonably bigger than average databases
- Serving
   - Returns results from what is contained in their index

A search engine's web crawler (or spider) is a type of bot (automated program) that traverses the internet and indexes webpages so that they appear in search results. While these bots crawl a vast number of webpages, they won't crawl everything. Some types of web crawlers may be disallowed by the site owner, and other pages may not be accessible without logging in to the site.

### Boolean Searches

Boolean operators are words (or symbols) that assist in refining or expanding the parameters of your search. The three main Boolean operators we can use in Google, Bing, and other search engines are AND, OR, and - (the minus symbol).
