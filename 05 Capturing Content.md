It is important to record any information and online content that helps to address your information requirements. Your collection plan is a great place to document the sorts of content you expect to find and collect - this might include images, videos, text, URLs, social media posts and comments, news and journal articles, usernames, avatars, HTML code, and much more.

In some cases (particularly for law enforcement activities), content from open source investigations may end up as evidence - it's particularly important to record open source content accurately and thoroughly if there's a chance that it will come under court scrutiny.

Screen captures are an excellent way to document open source content as it appeared at a specific time. Screen capture images are also an excellent way of communicating relevant findings for your customer.

Remember, the online environment is always changing - a piece of information that was accessible one day may have been changed or deleted the next.

## Capturing Content as Evidence

Depending on your team and agency, you may have a requirement to capture online content that will be treated or used as evidence in a court scenario. 
It is a good idea to start a screen recording with a clock program showing the current and accurate time in your location.
