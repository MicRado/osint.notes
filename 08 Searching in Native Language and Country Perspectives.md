## Native Language Searching

At times, you may have a requirement to conduct ‘native language’ searches. Using linguistic resources within your team or agency is ideal for larger projects, but when you have a requirement to undertake basic native language searching, online translation engines will come in handy.

### Google Translate - https://translate.google.com/

Google Translate is a multilingual neural machine translation service which translates text, documents and websites from one language into another.

## Considerations

Translating languages such as Russian or Chinese into English might reduce the accuracy of the translated information

Mathematically, there is a significant potential for error when translating between languages (as each is different). The English language has roughly 600,000 unique words. In contrast, the Russian language only has 130,000. There are approximately 50,000 unique Chinese characters commonly used in about 400,000 words – however defining “word” is difficult in Chinese.

In this video, we will look at how to construct native language search queries to identify specific information of interest.
