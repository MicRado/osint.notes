Using open source information to inform policy, investigations or decision making has enormous opportunity such as the ability to easily access and share information. But using open source information also has it's challenges, such as the complexity of processing large amounts of data or being more vulnerable to deception from our adversaries.

Being aware of the challenges and opportunities of using open source information can help us improve our work and the advice that we ultimately provide to decision makers.

If we are working in an OSINT role, we also need to consider the ethics and legalities around open source information collection, processing and storage. For example, what do we need to do to ensure that our policies, processes and collection methods are ethical and legal. It is important for anyone working in an OSINT role, to seek legal advice and ensure that you and your organisation are compliant with any relevant state, national or international frameworks.

A side note: We mention APIs. APIs stand for application programming interface which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Or maybe better defined as: a method that website X can share and make information easily accessible to website Y. For example, there are a large amount of sites that have access to Twitter data, but, there is very few with Facebook data. This means the API is free to access and thus able to presented in different ways for better analysis.


Australian Privacy Privacy Principles and General Data Protection Regulation

The EUâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an example of non-Australian regulation of data, and is worth mentioning and it plays an important role in the wider digital environment.

The GDPR It is an EU regulation designed to enhance individuals' control and rights over their personal data. Simplifying the regulatory environment for international business, the GDPR dictates how organisations can use, process, and store personal data. But GDPR's reach extends beyond the EU; many other countries, such as Japan and Canada, have adopted similar data protection laws.

Impact on Law Enforcement and National Security Though GDPR is a global standard, law enforcement and government agencies often follow different policies or have exemptions for law enforcement, national security and public interest. For those involved in these areas, GDPR might not impact their daily activities in relation to OSINT. However, it's vital to check individual organisational policies, as they can differ.

What might this mean for the OSINT practitioner? The emphasis on data minimisation and privacy rights within GDPR could lead to less access to information. This might result in a reduction in publicly available personal data, as some platforms may restrict or anonymise data or implement stricter privacy settings and user controls to comply with the regulations. Therefore, OSINT collection methodologies might need to change, or more simply, the data we can obtain, may be reduced.

As a reminder - Always consult with your organisation policies to ensure compliance.
