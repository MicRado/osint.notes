Welcome to our first module about OSINT.

Before we jump into understanding OSINT, lets take a quick refresher of what intelligence is, and what it's not:

 - Intelligence is the product resulting from the processing, evaluation, analysis, integration, and interpretation of disparate pieces of information.
 - Intelligence is NOT information and NOT data.
 - Risk analysis is inherent in intelligence, but intelligence is not risk management.
 - Intelligence should include judgements and assessments.
 - Intelligence should use estimative language – judgements about likelihood and levels of confidence – in the supporting evidence. 
﻿Now, we know what it is and what it isn't - what is the purpose of intelligence?
  
  Support: Decision-making, policies and planning
  Enhance: Situational awareness
  Provide: Threat Warning
  Reduce: Uncertainty and Risk
  Maximise: Opportunity

Now, let's look at Open Source Intelligence (OSINT).
- OSINT is defined as the collection and analysis of publicly available information to obtain knowledge for a desired objective. It can be information obtained from any source or platform where the information is not protected against public disclosure.

- Open source information can be easily accessible but the amount of open source information available for collection can mean that we are faced with the difficult task of collecting, processing and analysing (to derive meaning from) large amounts of complex data and information. Additionally, while open source information is readily available on open platforms, some of these can be difficult to access or navigate like the Deep and Dark Web.

- OSINT is often considered to be an important adjunct to other intelligence collection disciplines such as Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) or Human Intelligence (HUMINT). But it can also be understood as a stand-alone intelligence discipline. The term OSINT not only refers to how the information was collected or the sources that the information was collected from, but it also describes the full process of collecting, processing, analysing and disseminating open source intelligence.
