The Open Source Intelligence Cycle is the same as the traditional Intelligence Cycle and follows the same process.

That said, if you're in an OSINT role, a few points are worth extra consideration.
  1. Know your intelligence requirements or questions that you are seeking to answer.
  2. Scope the collection tools, sources and methods that are available to you. And identify those that are most likely to help you answer your intelligence questions.
  3. Ensure that you have a rigorous and defendable process for evaluating your collection decisions and workflow.

The Intelligence Cycle:

Planning and Direction
 - Identify intelligence requirements
 - identify information gaps
 - determine what needs to be collected and how 
 - assess and plan timeframes
Collection
 - Collect raw data and infomation
 - record collection
 - identify information gaps
Processing 
 - Convert raw collected data into information
 - sort and prioritise information
 - identify early information gaps
 - refine collection plans
 - Organise information so that it is easily difested by analysts
Analysis 
 - Analyse and interpret information
 - Distill large quantities of information down into key points
 - Make judgements
 - Determine the SO WHAT?
Dissemination & Integration 
 - Communitcate analysis effectively
 - Distribution of intelligence product
 - Intergrate with other intelligence
